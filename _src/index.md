# Secular spirituality

You need faith in <i>something</i>.<br>
You need to live for <i>something</i> outside of yourself.<br>
You need a symbol that represents virtue.<br>
You need a ritual which regularly encourages humility and introspection.<br>
You need to be striving for something.

Without these things, you are living without a purpose.<br>
Without these things, you are only living for yourself.<br>
To live only for yourself is to live a craven life of fear, insecurity, and selfishness.<br>
To live only for yourself is ultimately meaningless.<br>
It is nihilism.

Narcisism is nihilism.<br>
Hedonism is nihilism.

Our mainstream western culture has become one of nihilism.<br>
There are no mainstream values any longer.<br>
There is nothing we can agree on<br>
Besides selfishness, profit, and consumption.

Our mainstream western culture has become one of narcissism.<br>
We are encouraged to worship ourselves on social media and dating apps,<br>
In our patterns of consumerism,<br>
In using others.

In worshiping ourselves, we create sickness.<br>
We build walls between ourselves and the world,<br>
Try to suck everything else in while slowly collapsing inward.

The antidote is to worship something else.<br>
But how?

That is the dilemma that we secular people find ourselves in.<br>
We were raised as rationalists, but we need faith.<br>
That is a human requirement, like food or water.<br>
Faith in something outside of ourselves<br>
Or we collapse inward.

How can we do that?<br>
Here is an idea.<br>
<br>

<strong>God need not be a man in the sky</strong>

God is a symbol.<br>
It is a symbol of those virtues and values which we aspire to.<br>
It is a symbol of the deep wisdom that lies within each of us,<br>
That perhaps lies within all things.

Worship the symbol<br>
to place your reason for existence outside of yourself.

Worship the symbol<br>
to keep your virtues and values in the forefront of your mind.<br>
<br>

<strong>Prayer is not supernatural</strong>

Prayer is a ritual.<br>
Rituals are about setting intention and authoring our lives.

Pray to god, the symbol of goodness,<br>
So that you remember what it means to be good.

Pray to god, the symbol of goodness,<br>
So that you remember you are living for something more than yourself.<br>
<br>

<strong>Integrate positive psychology into your daily prayer</strong>

Let the first few prayers be about what youâ€™re grateful for.<br>
Tell god about it.<br>
Thank the goodness in the universe for what it has given you.<br>
This will teach you to be more positive and grateful.

Let the next few prayers be about growth.<br>
Pray to god for wisdom.<br>
Pray to god for the strength to face your issues.<br>
Pray to god for insight and clarity.<br>
This will help you set intentions on the path to growth.

Let the last few prayers be about others.<br>
Pray for your family and friends.<br>
Pray that they overcome their challenges.<br>
Pray that they find love or contentment.<br>
This will help you to see outside yourself<br>
And connect with others more deeply<br>
<br>

<strong>Touch your heart as you pray</strong><br>
Draw your consciousness into your heart.<br>
It is the seat of your deeper wisdom,<br>
And rationalizing will only get you so far.<br>
<br>

<strong>Have faith</strong> in goodness.<br>
Have faith in the natural order.<br>
Have faith in the symbol of god,<br>
And god will come alive within you.

Maybe god is a supernatural entity<br>
Like Yahweh, that listens to our prayers<br>
Through the fabric of the universe.

Or maybe we create god<br>
And forge the symbol,<br>
Manifesting the goodness in our communities.

Either way, god is real.<br>
Either way, god is powerful.

If your soul is not eternal,<br>
Then it is still the gestalt of your being.<br>
You still feel the weight of your existence.<br>
You still feel joy,<br>
Still feel pain,<br>
Still suffer.

Pray to god and save your soul.<br>
Pray to god and save your higher self from your lower self.

You are one of many<br>
And <strong>we are all connected<br>
In our joy and our suffering.</strong>

Find your virtue.<br>
Leave the world a better place than you found it,<br>
For all our sakes.
